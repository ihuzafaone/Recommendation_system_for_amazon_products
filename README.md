# Amazon Product Recommendation System

## Problem Statement  
Design a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform to personalize product suggestions, improving user engagement and boosting sales.

## Project Overview
E-commerce platforms like Amazon rely on advanced recommendation systems to deliver tailored product suggestions based on individual user preferences and behavior. Amazon currently uses an item-to-item collaborative filtering approach, a powerful technique that can handle large datasets while producing real-time, high-quality recommendations. This approach works by matching each of a user’s purchased or rated items with similar items, then aggregating these similar items to create a personalized recommendation list.

In this project, we will build a recommendation system specifically for Amazon’s Electronics category. Our goal is to create a model that can analyze past customer interactions to suggest relevant products, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to understand the dataset’s structure and key characteristics.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implement item-to-item collaborative filtering to generate recommendations based on users' past interactions.
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Explore content-based filtering methods to provide additional insights and recommendations based on product attributes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate and improve the accuracy and relevance of our recommendation model.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the model can handle large datasets, simulating a real-world scenario.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   We will use the Amazon Reviews data repository, specifically the Electronics dataset, to simulate real-world interactions on an e-commerce platform. The dataset includes customer reviews, ratings, and metadata, providing insights into user preferences and product similarities.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - **Cleaning**: Remove incomplete or irrelevant entries.
   - **Transformation**: Convert text-based data into structured formats for analysis.
   - **Normalization**: Standardize product IDs, user IDs, and other fields to ensure consistency.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize key trends, such as popular products, common rating patterns, and user demographics.
   - Identify clusters of similar products and analyze customer preferences.

4. **Modeling Techniques**  
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Create an item-to-item collaborative filtering model that suggests products based on a user’s past interactions with similar items.
   - **Content-Based Filtering (Optional)**: Develop a content-based filtering model that recommends items based on product attributes (e.g., category, brand, features).
   - **Hybrid Model**: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering to leverage the strengths of both approaches.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assess the model's performance using recommendation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Conduct A/B testing to compare model variations and measure user engagement improvements.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if using deep learning methods)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Dataset Information
The dataset for this project is sourced from the Amazon Reviews data repository maintained by Julian McAuley at UC San Diego. The repository contains multiple datasets across various product categories. For this project, we will focus on the **Electronics** dataset, which includes reviews, ratings, and metadata for a variety of electronic products.

- **Source**: [Amazon Reviews Data - Electronics](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)
- **Fields**:
  - `reviewerID`: Unique identifier for each reviewer
  - `asin`: Amazon Standard Identification Number for products
  - `reviewText`: Text content of the review
  - `overall`: Overall rating provided by the reviewer
  - `summary`: Brief summary of the review
  - Additional metadata like product category, brand, and price (if available)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ihuzfaone/Recommendation_system_for_amazon_products
   cd Recommendation_system_for_amazon_products
